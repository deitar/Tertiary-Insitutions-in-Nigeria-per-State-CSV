This solution is inspired by this repo: https://github.com/bc2mighty/tertiary-institutions-in-Nigeria-per-state/blob/master/states.json. 

The data is stored in json format and I need it in CSV but couldn't find an online tool for quick conversion. Code is written in python, however if the url link to the original raw data is no longer active, you can point the code to the replica available on this repo.

Thanks
